# Security Audit Report - C4GT Website Project

**Date:** January 24, 2025  
**Audited Repository:** c4gt-website  
**Services Audited:** AWS S3, CodeBuild, Bedrock, EC2 Infrastructure  

## Executive Summary

This security audit examines the C4GT website project's implementation of AWS services including S3 storage, EC2 deployment, and infrastructure security. The audit reveals several security concerns that require immediate attention, particularly around credential management, IAM policies, and S3 bucket configurations.

## AWS Services Analysis

### 1. Amazon S3 Storage Implementation

**File:** `cloud/storage/storage.py`

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Uses boto3 SDK for S3 operations
- ‚úÖ Implements proper error handling with ClientError exceptions  
- ‚úÖ Uses environment variables for AWS credentials
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Direct credential access in code (lines 18-27)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH:** Bucket name exposed via environment variable without validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM:** No IAM role-based authentication implemented

**Security Issues:**
1. **Hardcoded credential pattern:** While using environment variables, the implementation directly accesses AWS credentials in application code
2. **Missing bucket validation:** No verification of bucket existence or ownership
3. **Overly permissive operations:** Functions allow arbitrary bucket operations without access controls

**Recommendations:**
- Implement IAM roles for EC2 instances instead of access keys
- Add bucket validation and ownership verification
- Implement least-privilege access controls
- Add encryption at rest and in transit

### 2. CodeBuild Configuration

**Findings:**
- ‚ùå **NO CODEBUILD CONFIGURATION FOUND**
- No `buildspec.yml` or CodeBuild-specific files detected
- No CI/CD pipeline configuration present

**Security Implications:**
- No automated security scanning in build process
- No dependency vulnerability checks
- Manual deployment increases security risks

**Recommendations:**
- Implement CodeBuild with proper buildspec.yml
- Add SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools
- Configure dependency scanning
- Implement secure build environment

### 3. Amazon Bedrock Integration

**Findings:**
- ‚ùå **NO BEDROCK INTEGRATION FOUND**
- No AI/ML model integration detected
- No Bedrock-specific SDK usage found

**Note:** Despite being requested for audit, Bedrock services are not currently implemented in this codebase.

### 4. Infrastructure Security (EC2)

**File:** `ec2.md`

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Documents security group configuration
- ‚úÖ Includes SSL/TLS configuration with Let's Encrypt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM:** Uses t2.medium instance (consider t3.medium)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM:** Default security group rules may be overly permissive

**Security Concerns:**
1. **SSH Access:** Limited to specific IP (good practice)
2. **HTTP/HTTPS:** Open to all (0.0.0.0/0) - standard but requires monitoring
3. **Instance Type:** Older generation, missing enhanced security features

## Environment Configuration Security

### Configuration Files Analysis

**Files Examined:**
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- `Dockerfile` - Container security

**Findings:**

#### Environment Variables (`.env.example`)
- ‚úÖ Separates secrets from code
- ‚úÖ Includes AWS credential placeholders
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW:** No validation or format requirements specified

#### Docker Configuration
- ‚úÖ Multi-stage build reduces attack surface
- ‚úÖ Non-root user implementation (`appuser`)
- ‚úÖ Health checks implemented
- ‚úÖ Minimal base image (python:3.9-slim)

#### Security Best Practices Implemented:
- Container runs as non-root user
- Health checks for service monitoring
- Environment variable separation
- Minimal package installation

## Critical Security Issues

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Credential Management**
   - **Issue:** AWS credentials in application code
   - **Impact:** Potential credential exposure
   - **Solution:** Implement IAM roles for EC2 instances

2. **Missing IAM Policies**
   - **Issue:** No IAM role configurations found
   - **Impact:** Overly permissive access
   - **Solution:** Create least-privilege IAM policies

3. **S3 Bucket Security**
   - **Issue:** No bucket policy configurations
   - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access
   - **Solution:** Implement bucket policies and versioning

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Lack of CI/CD Security**
   - **Issue:** No automated security scanning
   - **Impact:** Vulnerabilities may go undetected
   - **Solution:** Implement CodeBuild with security tools

2. **Infrastructure Monitoring**
   - **Issue:** No CloudWatch or monitoring configuration
   - **Impact:** Security incidents may go unnoticed
   - **Solution:** Implement CloudWatch alerts and logging

3. **Database Security**
   - **Issue:** MySQL credentials in environment
   - **Impact:** Database exposure risk
   - **Solution:** Use AWS RDS with IAM authentication

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)

1. **Implement IAM Roles**
   ```bash
   # Create IAM role for EC2 instance
   aws iam create-role --role-name C4GT-S3-Access-Role
   ```

2. **S3 Bucket Hardening**
   - Enable versioning
   - Configure bucket policies
   - Enable server-side encryption
   - Block public access

3. **Environment Security**
   - Rotate all AWS credentials
   - Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Enable CloudTrail logging

### Short-term Goals (1 month)

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Create `buildspec.yml` for CodeBuild
   - Integrate SAST tools (SonarQube/CodeQL)
   - Add dependency scanning

2. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Configure CloudWatch logs
   - Set up security alerts
   - Implement AWS Config rules

### Long-term Strategy (3 months)

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Migrate to AWS CDK/CloudFormation
   - Version control infrastructure
   - Implement automated compliance checks

2. **Advanced Security**
   - Implement AWS WAF
   - Add DDoS protection
   - Consider AWS Shield Advanced

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- Consider GDPR compliance for user data
- Add data retention policies

### Access Controls
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Regular access reviews
- Principle of least privilege

## Conclusion

While the C4GT website project demonstrates good containerization practices, significant security improvements are needed in AWS service integration. The primary concerns center around credential management, IAM configurations, and the absence of automated security scanning.

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Immediate Action Required:** Yes  
**Estimated Remediation Time:** 2-4 weeks  

## Next Steps

1. Address HIGH priority issues immediately
2. Implement monitoring and alerting within 1 week
3. Create comprehensive IAM policies
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline with security gates
5. Schedule quarterly security reviews
